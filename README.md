**SceneShift** is a terminal-first process optimizer built with Go and Bubble Tea. 

It lets you **kill or suspend background applications**, freeing CPU and RAM before gaming or rendering — clean, fast, and zero-bloat. Think of it as switching into a new “performance scene” for your machine.

## ⚡ Quick Start

You don't need to install Go or compile anything to get started.

1.  **Download** the latest `.exe` from the **[Releases Page](https://github.com/tandukuda/SceneShift/releases)**.
2.  **Move** the file to a folder (e.g., `Documents/SceneShift`).
3.  **Run** `SceneShift.exe`.
    * *Note: It will request Administrator permissions to manage your processes.*

That's it! Use the **Spacebar** to toggle apps and **K** to kill them.

## 🛡️ Safety & Disclaimer
SceneShift interacts with system processes. While built with safety in mind, always save your work before using the "Kill" command.
