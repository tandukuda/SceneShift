## What is SceneShift?

If you’re tired of manually closing dozens of apps before **gaming, rendering, or streaming**, SceneShift turns that ritual into a **single performance switch**.

**SceneShift** is a keyboard-first, terminal UI (TUI) process optimizer for Windows.  
It lets you **kill or suspend background applications** to instantly free CPU and RAM—clean, fast, and zero-bloat.

Think of it as switching your machine into a new **performance scene**.

## Why SceneShift Exists

Before SceneShift, performance prep meant:
- Opening Task Manager
- Hunting background apps
- Killing the wrong thing
- Repeating this every session

SceneShift removes that friction.

It was built to be:
- **Fast** — one keypress, one scene
- **Safe** — critical processes are protected
- **Opinionated** — curated lists, smart defaults
- **Professional** — no gimmicks, no bloat

---

## 🆕 What’s New in v2.1.1

This release focuses on **clarity, safety, and polish**, based directly on user feedback.

- Clearer terminology: *Safelist* → **Exclusion List**
- Expanded, curated safe‑to‑kill process lists
- Improved safety indicators for protected / caution processes
- Automatic config migration from v2.1.0
- Expanded protection for Windows‑critical processes
