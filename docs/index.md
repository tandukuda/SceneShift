# Welcome to SceneShift

**SceneShift** is a terminal-first process optimizer built with [Go](https://go.dev/) and [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).

It is designed for gamers and 3D artists who need every bit of performance. SceneShift allows you to **kill or suspend** background applications to free up CPU and RAM before launching a heavy task—clean, fast, and zero-bloat.

Think of it as switching into a new "performance scene" for your machine.
