# SceneShift Documentation

SceneShift is a terminal-based utility for managing application states on Windows. It helps you reclaim system resources quickly by switching your PC into predefined *scenes* — focused system states tailored for work, gaming, streaming, or recovery.

SceneShift is opinionated by design: fast execution, minimal UI, and explicit control.

## What SceneShift Solves

Modern Windows workflows accumulate background apps silently. Launchers, updaters, browsers, sync tools — all consuming RAM and CPU.

SceneShift exists to:
- reduce friction before performance-critical tasks
- replace manual task-killing rituals
- make system state management repeatable

## Core Concepts

**Scenes**  
A scene is a named preset that defines which applications should be suspended or terminated.

**Modes**
- Kill: force-close selected processes
- Suspend: pause processes without terminating them

**Snapshots**
Capture system memory state before and after a scene switch.
