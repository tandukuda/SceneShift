# Safety & Disclaimer

!!! warning "System Stability Warning"
    **SceneShift interacts directly with system processes.**
    
    While the application is built with safety in mind, terminating essential system applications or drivers may cause system instability, crashes, or data loss.
    
    - Always save your work in other applications before using Kill Mode.
    - Avoid terminating processes if you are unsure of what they do.
    - Use the "Suspend" feature if you are hesitant about killing a process entirely.
    
## 🛡️ Safelist (NEW in v2.1)

SceneShift includes a built-in safelist of Windows critical processes:

```
explorer.exe, dwm.exe, csrss.exe, lsass.exe, services.exe,
winlogon.exe, svchost.exe, RuntimeBroker.exe, and more...
```

**Features:**
- Press `W` to manage your safelist
- Add custom processes you never want to kill
- Protected processes show `[SAFE]` tag when attempted
- Fully customizable
