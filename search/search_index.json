It helps you manage system resources by allowing you to quickly kill, suspend, or restore background applications. What SceneShift Solves Modern Windows systems accumulate background processes over time. Game launchers, update services, chat applications, and browser tabs consume RAM and CPU resources even when not actively in use. SceneShift exists to: - Reduce manual task management before performance-critical work - Make system resource optimization repeatable and consistent - Provide transparency into which processes are consuming resources - Enable quick switching between different performance states Core Concepts Modes SceneShift offers four process management modes: Kill Mode : Force-terminate processes to reclaim maximum resources. Useful when you need immediate RAM availability. Suspend Mode : Pause processes without closing them. The process state is preserved in memory while CPU usage drops to zero. Ideal for keeping applications ready to resume. Resume Mode : Unpause suspended processes. All threads continue execution from where they were frozen. Restore Mode : Relaunch terminated applications using their stored executable paths. Presets Presets are named configurations that group applications together. Each preset can be triggered with a single keypress, allowing you to switch your system into different performance states instantly. Examples: - Gaming Mode: Kill Discord, Spotify, Chrome, game launchers - Work Mode: Kill entertainment apps, keep communication tools - Streaming Mode: Suspend everything except streaming software Safety Levels Applications are categorized by safety level to prevent accidental system instability: Protected : Critical Windows processes that cannot be terminated or suspended. These are essential for system operation. Safe : Applications verified as safe to terminate. These are typically user-level programs that can be closed without system impact. Caution : Processes that may affect system functionality. Terminating these might cause unexpected behavior. Session Management Session history tracks all operations performed during your current SceneShift session. You can review what you've done and undo the most recent operation if needed. Getting Started Installation SceneShift requires Windows 10 or newer and must run with Administrator privileges for process management. The recommended installation method is via Scoop package manager. Manual installation is also supported. First Launch On first launch, SceneShift creates a default configuration and prompts you to select a color theme. The interface then displays the main menu where you can begin adding applications to manage. Basic Workflow Add applications you want to manage (press 'n') Select applications using arrow keys and spacebar Choose an action (Kill, Suspend, Resume, or Restore) Confirm during the 5-second countdown Review results and return to the main menu Configuration All settings are stored in human-readable YAML files in the same directory as the executable. You can edit these files directly or use the built-in management interfaces. Use Cases For Gamers Free RAM before launching resource-intensive games by suspending or killing background applications. Resume everything after your gaming session ends with a single command. For Developers Terminate notification services, update checkers, and communication apps before compiling large projects or running resource-intensive development tasks. For Content Creators Ensure stable frame rates during recording or streaming by eliminating background CPU usage. Suspend applications rather than killing them to preserve your workflow state. For 3D Artists Maximize available RAM before starting long render jobs. Suspend all non-essential applications to free memory while keeping your workflow intact for when the render completes. Safety and Responsibility SceneShift provides direct access to Windows process management. While the software includes safeguards for critical system processes, users are responsible for understanding the impact of their actions. Best practices: - Save your work before running operations - Test new presets in non-critical situations first - Review the exclusion list to understand which processes are protected - Back up your configuration before making major changes Additional Resources For detailed usage instructions, see the Usage Guide. For troubleshooting common issues, see the Troubleshooting section. For information about configuration options, see the Configuration Guide.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#sceneshift-documentation","text":"SceneShift is a terminal-based process optimizer for Windows.

General Issues SceneShift Won't Start Symptom : Double-clicking the executable does nothing or shows an error. Common Causes and Solutions : Not running as Administrator Right-click SceneShift.exe Select \"Run as administrator\" Configure your shortcut to always run as admin (see Installation guide) Missing dependencies Install Visual C++ Redistributable (x64) Download from Microsoft's website Restart computer after installation Antivirus blocking execution Check your antivirus quarantine Add SceneShift.exe to the exclusion list Unsigned executables may trigger false positives Corrupted download Re-download the executable Verify file size matches the release page Extract again if using zip file Configuration File Errors Symptom : Error message about config.yaml on startup. Solutions : Corrupted configuration Delete config.yaml SceneShift will regenerate it on next launch Your apps and presets will be lost (back up config.yaml regularly) Invalid YAML syntax Open config.yaml in a text editor Check for proper indentation (use spaces, not tabs) Ensure colons have a space after them Verify quotes are balanced Permission issues Ensure SceneShift folder is not in a protected location Move to Documents folder if in Program Files Check folder permissions allow write access Process Management Issues Process Won't Terminate Symptom : Attempting to kill a process shows an error or does nothing. Common Causes : Process is protected Check for shield icon next to process name Protected processes cannot be terminated for safety Remove from exclusion list only if you understand the risk Insufficient privileges Verify SceneShift is running as Administrator Some system services require additional permissions Try suspend mode instead of kill mode Process name mismatch Verify the process name exactly matches Task Manager Process names are case-insensitive but must be spelled correctly Some apps have multiple processes (check all variants) Protected by another application Antivirus software may protect certain processes Game anti-cheat systems prevent process termination Temporarily disable protection to manage these processes Suspend Operation Fails Symptom : Attempting to suspend a process shows an error. Solutions : Modern Windows app (UWP) UWP apps cannot be suspended by third-party tools These apps use different process architecture Use kill mode instead for UWP applications System service Windows services require special handling SceneShift cannot suspend most system services Check if process is in exclusion list Already suspended Check status indicator If already showing suspended, no action needed Use resume mode to unsuspend first Resume Operation Fails Symptom : Resume doesn't work or resumes wrong instance. Common Causes : Process no longer exists Original process may have been terminated Windows may have reused the Process ID SceneShift validates PID before resuming Multiple instances running SceneShift tracks specific PIDs Newly launched instances won't be affected This is intentional behavior to prevent mistakes Process already running Check status indicator If showing running, already resumed May need to suspend again first Restore Operation Fails Symptom : Applications don't launch when restored. Common Causes : Executable moved or deleted Verify the executable path in app configuration Edit the app entry and update the path Use Ctrl+F to search for the current location Insufficient permissions Some applications require specific user context Try running SceneShift as the user who installed the app Administrator privileges may not be enough for some apps Application requires specific launch arguments SceneShift launches without arguments Add a launcher script if arguments are needed Point the executable path to the script Application prevents multiple instances Some apps only allow one running instance If already running, restore will fail Check Task Manager before attempting restore Interface Issues Text Appears Garbled or Unreadable Symptom : Strange characters or missing text in the interface. Solutions : Terminal encoding issue Run SceneShift in Windows Terminal instead of CMD Windows Terminal has better Unicode support PowerShell also provides better rendering Font doesn't support icons Install a font with icon support (Cascadia Code, Fira Code) Configure your terminal to use the new font Restart SceneShift after font installation Console window too small Maximize the terminal window SceneShift requires minimum 80x24 character display Resize manually if auto-resize doesn't work Colors Don't Display Correctly Symptom : All text appears in the same color or colors are wrong. Solutions : Terminal doesn't support colors Use Windows Terminal or PowerShell CMD has limited color support Consider switching terminals for better experience Theme issue Press 't' to change theme Try a different theme to verify Check theme.yaml for corrupted values UI Updates Slowly or Freezes Symptom : Interface is unresponsive or laggy. Solutions : Too many processes tracked SceneShift updates stats for all apps Reduce number of configured apps Stats are cached but updates still consume resources Terminal performance Windows Terminal generally performs better than CMD Try a different terminal emulator Close other terminal sessions Background CPU usage Other applications may be consuming resources Check Task Manager for CPU bottlenecks Close unnecessary background apps Feature-Specific Issues Presets Don't Work Symptom : Pressing preset hotkey does nothing or selects wrong apps. Solutions : Hotkey conflict Verify hotkey doesn't conflict with existing keybindings Use single character or number Avoid keys used by Windows or terminal App names don't match Preset uses app names, not process names Check spelling in preset configuration Names are case-sensitive in config.yaml Preset not saved Verify preset appears in preset manager Check config.yaml contains the preset Try recreating the preset Import Configuration Fails Symptom : Attempting to import a profile shows an error. Solutions : Invalid JSON file Verify file is valid JSON Use a JSON validator online Check for syntax errors in the file Version incompatibility Profile may be from newer SceneShift version Update SceneShift to latest version Check metadata.sceneshift_version in profile File not found Ensure profile file is in SceneShift directory Check filename matches exactly (case-sensitive) Verify file wasn't moved or deleted No profiles in list Files must be named sceneshift-profile-*.json Check file extensions are .json not .txt Export a test profile to verify filename format Undo Doesn't Work Symptom : Undo operation fails or shows error. Solutions : Nothing to undo Undo only works for most recent operation History is cleared when SceneShift exits Verify an operation was actually performed Executable paths missing Undo kill requires valid executable paths Edit app configurations to add missing paths Cannot restore apps without path information Processes no longer exist Undo suspend requires original PIDs to exist If processes were terminated externally, undo fails This is expected behavior Session History Empty Symptom : Pressing 'h' shows no history. Solutions : No operations performed History only tracks kill/suspend/resume/restore App management doesn't create history entries Perform an operation to populate history History cleared on exit Session history is not persistent Intentional behavior to keep memory usage low Export logs if you need permanent record Performance Issues High CPU Usage Symptom : SceneShift itself consumes significant CPU. Solutions : Stats collection overhead Stats update in background Cached for 2 seconds to minimize impact Consider reducing number of tracked apps Large process list SceneShift enumerates all processes periodically This is normal behavior CPU usage should be < 5% when idle High Memory Usage Symptom : SceneShift uses more RAM than expected.

Themes Changing Themes Press 't' in the main menu Navigate through available themes Theme previews in real-time Press Enter to apply Press Escape to return without changing Customizing Themes In the theme selector, press 'e' Modify color hex codes Changes preview immediately Press Enter to save as custom theme Press Escape to discard changes Safety Features Exclusion List The exclusion list contains processes that cannot be killed or suspended. This prevents accidental termination of critical Windows components. Press 'w' to open exclusion list manager Review protected processes Type process name and press Enter to add Navigate to a process and press 'd' to remove Default exclusions include explorer.exe, dwm.exe, and other essential Windows processes. Safety Indicators Each application shows a safety indicator: - Shield icon: Protected (cannot be modified) - Checkmark: Safe to kill - Warning sign: Use caution These indicators help you make informed decisions about which processes to manage. Process Information The main menu displays real-time information for each application: - Status indicator (running, suspended, or not found) - Safety level - CPU usage percentage - RAM consumption in megabytes This information updates automatically while the interface is active. Keyboard Reference Main Menu Actions 'K': Kill selected processes 'S': Suspend selected processes 'U': Resume suspended processes 'R': Restore terminated processes Management 'n': New application 'e': Edit application 'd': Delete application 'p': Manage presets 't': Change theme 'w': Manage exclusion list Advanced Features 'h': View session history 'u' or Ctrl+Z: Undo last operation Ctrl+E: Export configuration 'i': Import configuration '?': Toggle help display 'q': Quit application Preset Triggers Press any configured preset hotkey (1-9, letters) to activate that preset. Tips and Best Practices Before Critical Tasks Test your presets in low-risk situations before relying on them for important work. Regular Backups Export your configuration periodically to preserve your optimized setup. Reviewing Changes Use session history to verify what operations were performed if unexpected behavior occurs. Suspension vs Termination Use suspend mode when you want to preserve application state. Use kill mode when you need maximum resource reclamation.
